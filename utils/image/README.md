# ImagerJs

ImagerJs is a JavaScript library for uploading images using drag & drop. 
Crop, rotate, resize, or shrink your image before uploading.

It is a platform-independent, web-based JavaScript Image Uploader that is very easy to use.

## ⚠️ Attention

**This library is no longer maintained**. If you're looking for an alternative you can check out [Doka Image Editor](https://pqina.nl/doka/). It supports every ImagerJs feature and much more (resizing, free rotating, color adjustment, photo filters, annotating, etc).
